This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in a Python function. The function `function_with_uncommon_error` has a potential `ZeroDivisionError` if `x` is 0, however this is not the primary problem.  The core issue is the handling of the edge case where both `x` and `y` are 0.  The function returns 0 in this scenario, which may not be the expected or mathematically correct behavior, depending on the intended use case. The solution file offers a refined implementation that handles this case explicitly for better clarity and robustness.
